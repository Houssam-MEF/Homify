   Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Default Users

After running the seeder, you'll have:

- **Admin User**: 
  - Email: `admin@example.com`
  - Password: `password`
  - Access: Full admin panel access

- **Regular Users**: 5 client users with faker data

## Project Structure

### Models & Relationships
- **User**: Has orders, addresses, and carts
- **Category**: Self-referencing hierarchy with products
- **Product**: Belongs to category, has images, soft deletes
- **Cart & CartItem**: Session or user-based shopping cart
- **Order & OrderItem**: Complete order management
- **Address**: Billing and shipping addresses
- **Payment**: Stripe payment tracking

### Key Services
- **CartService**: Handles all cart operations, merging, and calculations
- **StripePaymentService**: Manages PaymentIntents and webhook processing

### Controllers
- **Client Controllers**: Catalog, Cart, Checkout, Payment, Order
- **Admin Controllers**: Category and Product management

### Routes Structure
```
/                           # Home page
/c/{slug}                   # Category pages
/p/{slug}                   # Product pages
/panier                     # Cart (French for shopping cart)
/checkout                   # Checkout process
/orders                     # Order history
/admin                      # Admin panel
/webhooks/stripe           # Stripe webhooks
```

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
- `users` - User accounts with role column
- `categories` - Hierarchical product categories
- `products` - Product catalog with pricing and inventory
- `product_images` - Product image management
- `carts` & `cart_items` - Shopping cart system
- `orders` & `order_items` - Order management
- `addresses` - Customer addresses
- `payments` - Payment tracking

### Money Storage
All monetary values are stored as integers in minor units (cents) with separate currency codes, following financial best practices.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
php artisan test
```

### Test Coverage
- Cart functionality (add, update, remove, merge)
- Checkout process (address validation, order creation)
- Admin operations (CRUD, permissions)
- Payment integration (mocked Stripe operations)

## Stripe Integration

### Setup Webhooks
1. Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
2. Point to: `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/stripe`
3. Listen for: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook secret to `.env`

### Payment Flow
1. Customer completes checkout
2. PaymentIntent created with order metadata
3. Customer confirms payment with Stripe Elements
4. Webhook confirms payment success
5. Order status updated, stock decremented

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
1. Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`
2. Configure proper database and Redis queue
3. Set up SSL certificate
4. Configure file storage (S3 recommended)
5. Set up proper logging and monitoring
6. Configure Stripe live keys

### Performance Optimization
- Enable Laravel caching (config, routes, views)
- Use Redis for sessions and cache
- Implement queue workers for email and notifications
- Optimize database queries with eager loading
- Use CDN for static assets

## Security Features

- CSRF protection on all forms
- SQL injection prevention via Eloquent
- XSS protection with Blade escaping
- Role-based authorization with Gates
- Input validation with FormRequests
- Secure password hashing
- Stripe webhook signature verification
